# React Portfolio

## Description
This project is my freelance portfolio. It is a Single-page application created using React.js.

## Technologies Used
  * React.js
  * HTML
  * CSS
  
## User Experience
Users are able to click on the 2 different links at the top and will be taken to that specific component on the website. The portfolio component shows 6 web applications I have built and has icons that will take the user to either the application or the github page for the application. The Splash component shows my contact info and has a link to my resume.
